Life is simple, just add water.

Never trout yourself.

Keeping it reel.

I don’t say ‘good morning’,because if it was a good morning, I’d be out fishing… Oh wait.

Fish…

The best thing about fishing is there’s no one around to hear you talking to yourself.

I’m so god damn lonely.

*sobbing*

I love fishing. It’s so much better

than crying in the shower.

Fish taste so much better then melted icecream at 3AM crying in bed…. Um forget that I said anything
